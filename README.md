## Overview

WardSync is a church leadership app designed for ward and branch leaders to organize callings, assignments, members, reports, service needs, and follow-up tasks in one place. Leaders can track who is assigned, what needs to be done, due dates, progress, notes, and completion status.

The goal is to help bishoprics, branch presidencies, auxiliary leaders, and ward councils keep important responsibilities from getting lost in text messages, meeting notes, or memory. WardSync is not meant to replace official Church tools. It is a class project built to practice .NET web development, team collaboration, authentication, CRUD functionality, reporting, and accessibility improvements.

## The Problem It Solves

In a ward or branch, leaders often manage many moving pieces at the same time. There may be callings, releases, sustaining dates, service needs, youth activities, ministering follow-up items, interviews, meeting action items, and assignments from ward council.

It is easy for something important to get missed if it only lives in a text thread, notebook, spreadsheet, or someone’s memory. WardSync gives leaders a simple place to see what is open, who is assigned, what is overdue, and what has already been completed.

## Main Features

* Role-based login and navigation
* Dashboard overview
* Callings tracking
* Assignments tracking
* Follow-up tracking
* Members CRUD
* Reports page
* Report copy/download export
* Viewer read-only access where needed
* Admin approval/user management
* Accessibility and contrast improvements

## User Roles

WardSync uses role-based access so users only see the areas they are allowed to use.

### Admin

Admins have the highest level of access. They can manage users, view reports, manage members, and access private or administrative information.

### Leader

Leaders can manage the main ward/branch work areas, including callings, assignments, follow-ups, members, and reports.

### Viewer

Viewers can view allowed information but do not have full editing permissions. For example, Viewers can see the Members page, but they cannot add, edit, delete, or view private member status information.

## Web Pages

The web application includes several pages that work together to support communication, task management, and reporting.

### Home

The Home page is the main landing page. Guests can see the main features of the app before logging in. Logged-in users only see feature cards and links that match their role.

### Dashboard

The Dashboard gives users a quick overview of important items, such as open, completed, and overdue work.

### Callings

The Callings page is used to manage and track ward or branch callings. Users can view calling records, track status, add notes, and manage calling details.

### Assignments

The Assignments page is used to manage responsibilities assigned to leaders or members. Users can track assignment titles, descriptions, due dates, assigned leaders, priority, status, notes, and completion information.

### Follow-Ups

The Follow-Ups page is used to track ongoing action items from meetings, leadership discussions, or service needs. Follow-up items can include an assigned leader, due date, status, related family or household, and completion notes.

Private follow-ups are limited so they are not shown to users who should not have access.

### Members

The Members page is used to manage member information. Admin and Leader users can add, edit, and delete members. Viewer users can view the member list but cannot add, edit, delete, or view member status information.

Member fields include:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Phone
* Organization
* Current Calling
* Availability Notes
* Active Status

The Members page also includes email validation so blank or invalid emails do not save.

### Reports

The Reports page provides summaries from the system data. Users can view report information about assignments, callings, follow-ups, and members. The Reports page also includes a simple export feature that allows users to copy or download report text.

Private family information is masked as confidential in exported reports.

### Registration

The Registration page allows new users to create an account. Depending on the app settings, accounts may need admin approval before full access is granted.

### Login

The Login page allows users to sign in with their email and password. After logging in, users can access pages based on their assigned role.

### Admin User Management

The admin user management pages allow Admin users to review users, approve access, and manage user information.

## Application Navigation

WardSync uses a navigation menu and role-based page access. A user can register or log in from the home page. After login, the user sees navigation options based on their role.

For example:

* Admin users can access administrative tools.
* Leader users can manage leadership work areas.
* Viewer users can only view approved pages and do not see editing controls.

This helps keep the interface cleaner and prevents users from accessing tools they should not use.

## Development Environment

The project was developed using the following tools:

* Visual Studio Code
* Git
* GitHub
* .NET
* ASP.NET Core
* Blazor
* Entity Framework Core
* SQLite
* Trello
* Microsoft Teams

## GitHub Repository

Repository link:

https://github.com/jneberhard/WardSync

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the project:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click the green Code button.
3. Copy the repository link.
4. Open Visual Studio Code.
5. Open the Command Palette.
6. Choose Clone Git Repository.
7. Paste the repository link.
8. Choose a folder on your computer.
9. Open the cloned project folder.

## Restore Packages

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

This restores the required NuGet packages.

## Database

WardSync uses SQLite for local development. The database is managed with Entity Framework Core migrations.

To create or update the local database, run:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

If the local database gets out of sync during testing, the local SQLite database can be deleted and recreated. This should only be done for local development/testing data.

## Running the Program

To run the application locally, open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```

After the app starts, the terminal will show a local URL, such as:

```text
http://localhost:5131
```

Open that URL in a web browser to use the app.

## Project Management

Trello was used as the project management and planning tool. The team used Trello cards to organize tasks, track progress, assign responsibilities, and document completed work.

## Programming Language and Frameworks

### C# and .NET

C# was the main programming language used for the project. The .NET platform provided the runtime and tools needed to build and run the application.

### ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core was used to build the web application, handle routing, authentication, services, and server-side functionality.

### Blazor

Blazor was used to build the user interface with reusable components and C# code. This helped create interactive pages while keeping the project inside the .NET ecosystem.

### Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core was used for database access and migrations. It connects the app to the SQLite database and allows the app to work with models such as Members, Assignments, Callings, and Follow-Ups.

### SQLite

SQLite was used as the database for local development. It stores the application data in a local database file.

## Accessibility Work

The team worked on accessibility and contrast improvements during development. This included:

* Adding useful page titles.
* Adding labels for form fields.
* Adding labels for search inputs and filter dropdowns.
* Improving color contrast on buttons, badges, navigation, and important page areas.
* Fixing contrast issues found with WAVE and Chrome DevTools.
* Improving keyboard/accessibility behavior where needed.
